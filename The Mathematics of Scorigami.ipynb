    "# The Mathematics of Scorigami\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "On Monday Night Football, September 25, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers by a score of 25-11. This event marked the most recent [Scorigami](https://nflscorigami.com/): a game score which had not previously been recorded in the NFL. Scorigamis are rare but have become one of the most entertaining outcomes to cheer for in a game. To see an event that has never happened before is a remarkable feature, especially given that 17,428 NFL games have been played up to this point. \n",
    "\n",
    "I began pondering the probability of Scorigami's occuring, and realized that exploring this question would touch on some very important and interesting mathematical concepts. What was the probability of that Monday Night Football game ending in a score of 25-11? Which Scorigamis that we have not yet observed are most likely to occur next? "

    "To begin with, let's start with some seemingly trivial notions. First, a score is a tuple $(a, b)$ where $a$ is the number of points scored by team 1 and $b$ is the number of points scored by team 2. The number of points scored by each team is a nonnegative integer. Given that the highest NFL score in a game ever was 73 points in 1940 (a 73-0 victory by the Chicago Bears over the Washington Redskins), we can very safely assume that each score lies in the interval $[0, 100]$.

    "Now, we want to do something seemingly simple: we want to understand what the probability that a given score occurs is. From this point on, there is something deceptive at work here. In the first way of interpreting this situation, team 1 scores $a$ points and team 2 scores $b$ points. The team with more points is declared the winner (or it is a tie) and the score is recorded as $(a, b)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second way of interpreting this situation, team 1 plays team 2, and the outcome of the game is a score $(a, b)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why are these different? And why does it matter when it comes to Scorigami? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first situation, we imagine each team scoring a certain number of points--$\\textit{independent}$ of what the other team scored. So, we can consider the probability of a score $(a, b)$ to happen as the probability that team 1 scores $a$ points and the probability that team 2 scores $b$ points. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second interpretation, we are considering the $\\textit{joint}$ probability of a given score $(a,b)$ occuring. In this interpretation, fundamental to the score is that $a$ and $b$ may be related. We cannot consider them happening one at a time--the game is played between both, and these are inextricably linked. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many games happen seemingly like the first situation--the teams go out and each try to score on every possession. Often, a team that is good at scoring will put up many points, irrespective of what the other teams do. \n",
    "\n",
    "But it is clear that this is a simplification of reality. For instance, the amount of scoring you are able to do is certainly dependent on how much you have the ball--this is very different if you opponent has the ball for long, scoring drives, or if they are consistenly punting on 3 and outs. Furthermore, if the regulation ends in a tie, it is unlikely that the score will remain a tie after the game. Finally, there are crazy possibilities in the rules that have never occured like a safety on an extra point that would result in a score of 6-1, meaning that the only possible way to score one point is if the opponent also scores a touchdown. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of these considerations, it is clear that the best way to understand the probability that various scores occur needs to understand the joint probability of each score. However, as we proceed, it will be clear that this presents some major challenges to overcome. "

    "## Interpretation 1\n",
    "We will start by examining interpretation 1--namely, that each team scores points independently of the other team. Recall that each team scores a score between $[0, 100]$. We refer to these scores as the outcomes. When we say that the probability that team 1 scores 10 points is 8%, what we really mean is that there is some function $\\mathbf{P}$ such that $\\mathbf{P}(a = 10) = 0.08$. The probability function $\\mathbf{P}$ just assigns a number between 0 and 1 to the outcome that we were interested in--namely, that $a = 10$, or in english, that team 1 scored 10 points. I like to read the notation $\\mathbf{P}(a = 10)$ by saying, \"The probability that a is 10\". There are just a few conditions on the probability functions that we care about--for instance, if we want to calculate the probability that team 2 scores greater than 10 and less than 14 points, we would write it that $$\\mathbf{P}(10 < b < 14) = \\mathbf{P}(b = 11) + \\mathbf{P}(b = 12) + \\mathbf{P}(b = 13)$$"

    "## Empirical distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we want to know what the probability that the Scorigami score of 25-11 occurring is. According to this simplified scenario, this would be equal to the probability that team 1 scores 25 points and team 2 scores 11 points (or team 1 scores 11, team 2 scores 25). Since these are independent events, we can just multiply them: \n",
    "$$\\mathbf{P}((a, b) = (25, 11)) = \\mathbf{P}(a = 25)* \\mathbf{P}(b = 11)$$\n",
    "However, how do we know what the probability that a team scores 25 points is? It's not a very common score. One way of doing this is by constructing what is known as an empirical probability distribution. Empirical comes from the fact that we look at events that have already happened--NFL games--to try to understand how likely scoring is. We are assuming that there is some underlying law $\\mathbf{P}$ that says how likely scoring any number of points is, and to get a good guess at what $\\mathbf{P}$ is, we construct our empirical probability distribution, which to distinguish, I will denote $\\mathbf{P}_e$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The empirical probability distribution is defined in the most natural way we can think of--we assume that the probability that a certain score occurs is the frequency of it having occured in the past. Since there are 17,428 NFL games ever, there are 34,856 individual team scores that have been recorded. That's a lot! If we want to estimate the probability that a team scores 10 points in a game, we simply take the number of times a score of 10 has been observed, 1,952, and divide it by 34,856 to get 5.60%. We would write this as \n",
    "$$\\mathbf{P}_e(a = 10) = \\frac{1952}{34856} \\approx 0.0560$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find our empirical probability distribution, we're gonna use the help of our computer. "

    "Are these just statistical abberations? Random chance? How bad are these discrepancies, really? Let's take the most common game score, 20-17, as an example. The empirical model predicts that this score occurs with a probability of 0.8499%, so that in all games that have been played, we would expect to see it 148 times--but it's happened 284 times. If the true probability of a 20-17 score was 0.8499%, what would the probability be of having it happen at least 284 times in 17,428 games? This is a classical statistics problem known as finding the p-value. If an event is repeated $n$ times, and the probability of occurring at any one trial is $p$, then the probability of $k$ successes is given according to the Binomial distribution: \n",
    "$$\\mathbf{P}(x = k) = {n \\choose k} (p)^k(1-p)^{n-k}$$\n",
    "This takes a while to calculate if we need to add up the probabilities for $x = 284, 285, ..., 17428$ (or just adding up $x = 0, 1, ..., 283$ and subtracting this from 1). Fortunately, the binomial distribution approaches the normal distribution (the bell curve shape) as $n$ gets big enough. As a rule of thumb, to apply this approximation, you want $np \\geq 5$ and $n(1-p)\\geq 5$. Since $np = 17428*(0.008499) = 148.1$, we are safe to use this approximation. We want to find the probability that a Normal random variable with mean $np$ and a standard deviation equal to $\\sqrt{np(1-p)}$ has a value at least as large as 284 (since this is a continuous variable, we will take its value to be at least 283.5).

Let's call the joint probability of a game by $\\mathbf{P}_2$, to indicate that we consider this probability as the likelihood that a fixed score of $(a, b)$ (now that we care about the scores happening together, it's natural to assume that $a\\geq b$) occurs. Now, we can do exactly what we did before, and construct an empirical distribution of the probability that a given score $(a, b)$ happens. Only, let's take a look at our data for a minute"

This makes it impossible to use our personal information to accurately assess this.

The point is that when data is scarce, we need to incorporate whatever additional information we have to understand something. Then, if new information is presented, we can update our beliefs accordingly. This philosophy is the heart of what is known as Bayesian statistics. "

To define possession, we will say that a team has possession if they have possession when the play begins (so if a punt return, pick 6, fumble return, kick return, etc., happens, the scoring counts for the defensive team)\n",

In fact, a defensive safety during a conversion, while possible by the rules, has never happened.

    "To actually construct our prior, what we can do is create a model game in which teams take turns of being in possession of the football, and for every possession, one of the above outcomes occurs. We can empirically estimate the probability of any one of those outcomes occurring by looking at data on the course of football games. Although I will not do so here, one could even model the probability of something occurring, given what is happening in the game (score, time left). Now, the empirical probability of a (6, 1) event happening is 0. To assign this a nonzero probability, let's assume that such a play has a 1% chance of occurring in the next 100 years. There are around 20 drives in an average game, and 272 games in a season, so there are around 20*272*100= 544,000 drives in the next 100 years. Since it has a 1% chance of occurring, we'll set our probability to 0.01/544000 $\\approx 2*10^{-8}$. "
